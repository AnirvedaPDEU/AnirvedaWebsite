      "Anirveda, the techno-economics of PDEU, organizes a fun event 'Ambush Marketing' where rivaling companies compete against other by outdoing and directly attacking the rival’s marketing strategy to emerge as the best. The objective of the event is to engage participants in ‘ambush marketing’ and understand its impact on companies. In the event, students in a group of 2-4 advertise themselves by chaffing about their rival companies over their loopholes and hence showcasing how they are better. The judgement is based on two criteria: domination and creativity.",
