      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">Web development has evolved at a rapid pace, with new frameworks and technologies emerging every day. As we move toward a more dynamic and interactive web, it's essential to stay updated on the latest trends.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">The Rise of Serverless Architectures</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">Serverless computing has emerged as a solution that enables developers to build and run applications without managing servers. Services like AWS Lambda allow developers to write code without worrying about the infrastructure, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">JavaScript Frameworks: React, Vue, and Angular</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">JavaScript remains the backbone of modern web development. Frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js have simplified the development process, enabling developers to create fast, efficient, and scalable applications. These frameworks come with built-in tools that enhance developer experience.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">WebAssembly: Transforming Web Performance</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">WebAssembly (Wasm) allows developers to run high-performance code in web browsers. It provides near-native performance and is particularly useful for computationally intensive applications such as gaming and video editing. With Wasm, you can now run code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust directly in the browser.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">AI and Machine Learning Integration</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">The integration of AI and machine learning in web development is a game changer. Tools like TensorFlow.js allow developers to build machine learning models that run directly in the browser. AI can be leveraged to optimize user experiences, such as personalized content recommendations, predictive analytics, and enhanced search functionality.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">As we look to the future of web development, it's clear that new technologies will continue to shape the landscape. From serverless computing to AI and WebAssembly, these innovations offer exciting opportunities for developers to create more dynamic, interactive, and efficient applications.</p>

    excerpt:
      "Blockchain technology is transforming industries far beyond cryptocurrency. This post explores its fundamentals and real-world applications in various sectors.",
    content: `
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">Blockchain technology is more than just the foundation of cryptocurrency. It has the potential to revolutionize industries like supply chain management, healthcare, and financial services by providing a decentralized, secure way to manage and record transactions.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">What is Blockchain?</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">At its core, blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, and once a block is added, it cannot be altered, making it a highly secure way to record and manage data.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Blockchain in Supply Chain</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">In supply chain management, blockchain provides transparency by allowing all stakeholders to track the movement of goods from manufacturer to consumer. This not only reduces fraud but also ensures that products are ethically sourced and comply with industry regulations.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Blockchain in Healthcare</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">Blockchain can be used in healthcare to create a secure and transparent system for storing patient records. By using blockchain, healthcare providers can ensure that patient data is accessible only by authorized users, improving privacy and reducing errors.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Blockchain in Financial Services</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">In financial services, blockchain technology enables fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. It also eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks, making financial systems more efficient and accessible. With blockchain, we can expect to see more decentralized financial services emerging.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">The Future of Blockchain</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">The future of blockchain is promising, with many industries adopting the technology for greater transparency and security. As blockchain continues to evolve, we will see new use cases emerge, offering innovative solutions to long-standing problems in various sectors.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-Bebas text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-secondary opacity-80 mb-6">Blockchain technology is not just a passing trend. It has the potential to redefine how we interact with data, making it more secure, transparent, and decentralized. As blockchain technology matures, it will continue to have a profound impact on industries across the globe.</p>
